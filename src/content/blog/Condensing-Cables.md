The company built automation equipment that needed cabling between sub-systems.  The sub-systems differed in the gauge required, and the quantity of wires required, which led to the company buying and stocking over 20 different cables from different manufacturers.  The cables were also stored on the assembly floor on racks which needed to be manually removed to unspool the cable.

After a quick gathering of data on the different cable uses, it was noticed that many cables were similar in their applications. With the data, the team researched different cables and found that the company could condense from 20 different cables down to 5 cables. The new cables were stored on a spool rack to allow easy access and lessened the overall footprint.

This change allowed the electricians easier access to the cable they required, while also allowing the company to get a bulk discount saving between $25,000 â€“ $45,000 a year based on the equipment they sold.
