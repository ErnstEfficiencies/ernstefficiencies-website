The company was a contract manufacture for bone screws, which can require the heads to have texturing applied to a specific area. The company accomplished this with custom fixtures that would only allow the correct area be abrasively blasted.  All new screws received a new custom designed fixture despite the similarities between the customer products.

Data was gathered on all screws the company manufactured in the last ten years, with key feature dimensions listed with the customer part number. With this information, all screws were linked to an existing fixture with a focus on reducing duplicate fixtures. The new data also allowed for the dimensions to be integrated with their 3D modeling software and would create any new fixture and drawings if no existing fixture would work for the customer specifications.

Overall this project reduced the required inventory of unique fixtures, allowing bulk purchases which reduced pricing from suppliers, and automated engineering time for new bone screw production.
