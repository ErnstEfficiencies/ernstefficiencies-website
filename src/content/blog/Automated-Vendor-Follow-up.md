The purchasing agent at the company spent 3-4 hours a week on following up with vendors for their due dates.  The process was the purchaser would run a report in their ERP system, export the report as an Excel document, format the Excel document, then copy each vendorâ€™s section to a new Excel document that was sent by email to the vendor requesting updates.

The solution was creating an Excel document that had a list of all the vendor emails, and custom code written.  The purchaser now runs the report from their ERP system, copies the sheet into the new Excel document, and hits a run button.  The document formats, and creates temporary documents that are attached to a pre-written email and sent autonomously.  From running the report to the last email sent now takes approximately 15 minutes, under 10% of the time the process took prior.
